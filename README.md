# Project Introduction

The traditional museum audio tour experience is largely passive
There is limited opportunity to go off-script or have a two-way dialogue
Imagine if could engage with the artist to ask questions about creative choices and cultural context

Conversational AI chatbots that bring historical figures and subjects to life 
Instead of passively receiving  information
Visitors can take an active role by asking spontaneous questions tailored 
to their interests

**Becomes an individualized, interactive learning experience**
